actions:
  # for creating multiple cohorts where the only difference is the index date, then have multiple actions in the yaml, one for each index date
  # the range is specified as: --index-date-range "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD by (week|month)" 
  # as files are large, use csv.gz to make them smaller
